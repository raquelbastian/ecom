    "# Cosine Similarity-Based Product Recommendation\n",
    "This workflow demonstrates how to build a feature matrix and use cosine similarity to recommend similar products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early stages of this project, the goal was to build a streamlined, metadata-driven recommender. However, as we moved through Preprocessing and Feature Engineering, the data began to fight back. The very techniques intended to simplify the model—Correlation Analysis and Lasso Regression—instead acted as a 'Stress Test' that simple models could not pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to overcome the limitations of single-dimensional filtering, we adopted a multi-model hybrid architecture. This approach leverages various recommendation 'experts'—each utilizing cosine similarity to measure product-to-product relationships—which are then synthesized into a unified ensemble. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have tried 10 models and attempted to apply a weighted hybrid model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure each model contributes effectively, we evaluated their performance against our established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The final integration was achieved by assigning strategic weights to each model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the optimal weight distribution, we employed a Randomized Search optimization process. This allowed the system to iteratively test thousands of weight combinations, ultimately identifying the configuration that maximized the NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) score, ensuring our recommendations are both relevant and accurately ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our KPI and its corresponding target:\n",
    "NDCG@5 - Is the entire Top-5 list sorted perfectly from best to worst?, \n",
    "    target -> >0.80\n",
    "MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) - How quickly does the user find the first relevant item?\n",
    "    target -> 0.70\n",
    "Latency - How fast is the recommendation delivered?\n",
    "    target -> < 200ms"
